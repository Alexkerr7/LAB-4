### GitHub update
I have found that you can create folders on GitHub by going to the "create new file" button on the code screen of the repository, then typing in the name of the folder you want, a '/', and then the name of a file (you can use "test.md" if you don't know what file name you need.)

This will then allow you to create the file you want to submit the same way inside that folder, and then pasting the code you created into it.  I have noticed that GitHub has some issue formatting code, so you will need to do some formatting after you paste it.

This is an alternative to cloneing the repo, and then commmitting your changes, pushing them to your repo, and then creating a pull request for your changes.
